    We investigate collective behaviour in a network of adaptively coupled phase oscillators. The  coupling topology of the networks changes slowly depending on the dynamics of oscillators. We  show that such a system gives rise to numerous dynamics, including relative equilibria, hierarchical multi-cluster and chimera states. An analytic treatment of the multi-cluster solutions as well as the existence of a continuous family of these states are presented. A subsequent analysis  reveals parameter regimes of high multi-stability of these states. Our results contribute to the  understanding of pattern formation mechanisms in adaptive networks, such as emergence of  multi-layer structure of neural systems.
