\section{AMCOS}
The conference on Analysis and Modeling of Complex Oscillatory Systems (AMCOS) aims to bring together theoretical and experimental researchers working on the state of the art in the field of complex oscillatory systems.

The main topics of the conference comprise both (a) the modeling of complex systems and the emergence of collective behavior, as well as (b) the analysis of complex data sets in order to infer the underlying structure and functionality of networks. Particular focus will be put on oscillatory phenomena in neuroscience.

\section{COSMOS}

The AMCOS Conference is organized by the Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) of the Marie Curie Initial Training Network led by Arkady Pikovsky of Potsdam Univeristy. COSMOS trains 15 ESRs at the interface between Physics, Applied Mathematics, and Life Sciences, integrating theoretical and data-driven methods, in 7 universities across Europe.
