        Bacterial biofilm communities have been shown to exhibit oscillations in their growth rate, reflecting a periodic modulation in their stress levels. These oscillations are caused by a metabolic interplay between the biofilm interior and its periphery, which is coordinated by electrochemical signalling. Interestingly, the oscillations only emerge after the biofilm reaches a minimum size. In this talk I will describe the emergence of these oscillations in terms of both a minimal delay-differential equation model, and a biologically explicit model that combines metabolic co-dependence and electrical signaling between the interior and the periphery of the community.
